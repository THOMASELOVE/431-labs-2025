# 431 Lab X Instructions

## Completed Lab X submissions approved by Dr. Love

[Here is a list of completed websites](websites_2025.md) for students in the Fall 2025 class.

## Prior to attempting Lab X, we assume …

- You've completed Lab 1, and
- You’ve read sections 11 and 28-29 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

# What is this?

Lab X requires you to build a professional website, or augment your current one, if you already have one.

This is, we hope, a worthwhile opportunity for you to build your own professional website. Not only will this give you some additional practice coding and using R and R-adjacent tools like Quarto, it’s a low-cost and potentially high-yield method to establish your professional presence online. We also want to see if you can figure some things out on your own, of course.

To complete Lab X successfully, you must submit a permanent URL from which Dr. Love has to be able to open your website and read its contents.

Note that should you want Dr. Love to write a letter of recommendation for you in the future, he will be **much more willing** to do this if
you have an active website.

# Submitting your Website

Submit a link to your website to Dr. Love in an email with the subject line **My Website** by the deadline (it's in early December) specified in [the Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html). In the body of your email, briefly tell me how you created the site (Quarto, or something else.)

Once he's approved your site, Dr. Love will post it [here](websites_2025.md).

# Instructions and Guidance

We want you to build a professional looking website that will be useful to you. The content is (mostly) up to you, but it’s worth considering using this opportunity to craft your online presence.

## The Five Key Elements

Dr. Love will be happy if your site clearly includes at least the following five elements:

1.  A front page including a photo of you or of something relevant to you.
2.  Links to your social media presence, if any, and a way for people to get in touch with you via email.
3.  An About Me or Welcome section on your front page, which briefly describes what you’re doing now.
4.  Some information on your Education, Experiences, and/or Projects
5.  A way to download your CV

A blog is also an appealing way to connect your thoughts with the world, and including non-professional stuff is OK, too, of course.

# Using Quarto to Build the Site

## Can I use something other than R / Quarto to build my site?

Yes, but you’ll receive less credit than a good Quarto site would receive.

Good options to consider include [Owlstown](https://www.owlstown.com/), and [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), and each offers templates that would
work nicely.

Follow whichever approach is best for you and you feel most comfortable with. The key thing is to commit to making this a part of your life
going forward, however you most effectively do that. 

## What if I already have an active website?

If it includes the five elements listed above, great! You should definitely submit it to me as soon as possible.

## Should I spend a lot of money to have a fancy domain name?

No. There are many low-cost solutions if you want to register a domain and use it for this purpose. Google Domains can provide you with most
available domains for something like \$1 per month. I wouldn’t go much above that, and a free name is even better.

## Do I need to wait until the end of the term to work on this?

Not at all. I would expect most of you to be able to follow the templates and guides above to do the work once you’ve finished Lab 1. At
the end of the term, you will have a lot of work to do, so getting to this early is definitely a good idea.

## Will the TAs help me troubleshoot my website?

If they can, sure, but only after anyone else looking for 431 help has had their problem settled. I do not guarantee that we can help fix your
website problems.

## Grading Lab X

- Lab X is worth 25 points.
- Students will receive all 25 points if ...
    - their Lab X submission is on time, and
    - their Lab X site was built using Quarto, and
    - their Lab X site clearly includes [the five key elements listed above](#the-five-key-elements), and
    - their Lab X site has no unfixed typos or grammatical issues that Dr. Love notices in his review.
- Students will receive a maximum of 22/25 points if their site was built using something other than Quarto, but otherwise meets these standards.
