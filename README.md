## Tips for Lab Work

See [here](tips.md) for some tips to remember before submitting your Lab work.

## Getting Help During The Lab

You are welcome to discuss each Lab with Professor Love, the teaching assistants or your colleagues, but your answer must be prepared by you alone. 

- Don't be afraid to ask questions, using any of the methods described on our [Contact Us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/contact.html) page.
- If you decide to get help from a large language model (like ChatGPT) to help with your phrasing of ideas, or building code, OK, but you need to describe what you did carefully in the designated **AI Help** section (just before the Session Information) of your submission.

## Submitting Your Work

Each set of Lab instructions provides details on how to submit your work. Mostly, this is done through the Assignments folder in [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), but check the instructions.

## Grading

- Labs 1-6 are graded by the TAs and then reviewed by Dr. Love. Your grades will be available approximately one week after the Lab deadline. 
- Dr. Love reviews the Lab X submissions personally. 
 
## Answer Sketches and Grading Rubrics

As Labs 1-6 pass their deadlines (listed in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html)), we will:

- post the answer sketch (48 hours after the deadline) to our Shared Google Drive, and then
- post grades and any additional information about grading rubrics one week after the deadline to a location we will provide to you.

## Late Policy (No extensions)

- Note that your lowest lab score (out of Labs 1-6) over the course of the semester will be dropped before we calculate your lab grade.
- To receive full credit on a Lab, it must be received on Canvas no later than 59 minutes after the posted deadline. (This allows for small issues with uploading to Canvas to occur without penalty.)
- Labs that are turned in 1-48 hours after the deadline will lose 20% of available credit (10 points) for late work.
- No extensions to Lab deadlines will be made this semester. Labs turned in more than 48 hours after the deadline will receive no credit, since by then the Lab Sketch will be posted.

## Lab Regrade Requests will be reviewed in December

The **[Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2025-lab-regrade-request)** will open after Lab 1's grades are posted. 

We use this form to handle almost all grading errors and regrade requests on Labs. The only exception to this policy is when you believe we've made an arithmetic error in summing up your points on a lab. If that happens, just email Dr. Love to get it straightened out. The [Form](https://bit.ly/431-2025-lab-regrade-request) is used for all other regrade situations.

- If you want Dr. Love to review your grade on one (or more) of Labs 1-6, fill out the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2025-lab-regrade-request) any time before the deadline on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2025/calendar.html). Once you submit the form, you'll have the ability to edit it, so you can add to it later in the semester if necessary.
- When all other course work has been graded, Dr. Love will open the form. If you have requested additional points that could change your course grade, he'll review your request. If not, then he won't.
